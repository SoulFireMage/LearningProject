# Learning Project
Another learning project source controlled for my convenience. It has answers to various small exercises found on-line and set for myself. It is not intended to reflect commercial quality code. At best it may have the odd helpful snippet to others.

The plan is to build it out to a little student grades app using WPF and a rough implementation of of a mvvm layout. This will be done by hand in the first instance. I'll update the readme should the snippets here seem to be useful to anyone else.

There is little error checking outside of using reasonable constructs. You'll see side trips into exercise answers and exploring multiple ways to achieve the same end!
